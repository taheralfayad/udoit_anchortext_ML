Single-Dose Liposomal Amphotericin B for Cryptococcal Meningitis,0
J.N. Jarvis and Others,0
"Cryptococcal meningitis is a major complication of HIV infection. In this phase 3, randomized, controlled trial in sub-Saharan Africa, a single dose of liposomal amphotericin B induction therapy combined with fluconazole and flucytosine for cryptococcal meningitis was shown to be noninferior to standard induction therapy with amphotericin B deoxycholate and was associated with fewer adverse events.",0

"E.D. Moreira, Jr., and Others",0
"In an extension of the pivotal randomized trial showing vaccine efficacy, approximately 10,000 adults who had received two doses of BNT162b2 were assigned to receive a third dose or placebo. Local reactions were common but mild and transient. During a median follow-up of 2.5 months, SARS-CoV-2 was identified in 6 participants in the vaccine group and in 123 in the placebo group, for a vaccine efficacy of 95.3%.",0

"J.A. Rodriguez, C. Shachar, and D.W. Bates",0

Convalescent Antibodies after Omicron Infection,0
A. Rössler and Others,0
"Although considerable data show cross-reactivity among antibodies generated by infection with the various SARS-CoV-2 variants of interest, a group of persons who were not previously vaccinated but were recovering from infection with the omicron BA.1 variant were found to have antibodies that were largely ineffective in neutralizing the other viral strains.",0

Hydrocortisone to Prevent Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia,0
"Glucocorticoids might prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia in extremely preterm infants but have adverse neurodevelopmental effects. In this trial involving preterm infants, there was little difference in survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia or in the occurrence of neurodevelopmental impairment with hydrocortisone as compared with placebo.",0
Editorial Hydrocortisone to Prevent Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia — Not a Silver Bullet,0
M.R. Smith and Others,0
"Standard therapy for metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer is androgen-deprivation therapy, usually with docetaxel. A large, multinational, phase 3 trial assessed the addition of the androgen-receptor blocker darolutamide to standard therapy. At 4 years, survival was higher with darolutamide than with placebo (62.7% vs. 50.4%), with no major differences in the frequency of adverse events.",0
Trastuzumab Deruxtecan for HER2-Positive Breast Cancer,0
J. Cortés and Others,0
"In patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer that had progressed after primary therapy, treatment with the antibody–drug conjugate trastuzumab deruxtecan resulted in a higher response rate and longer progression-free survival than trastuzumab emtansine. Since trastuzumab deruxtecan was associated with interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, close monitoring of pulmonary function is warranted.",0

Expanded-Access Treatment for Ebola in DRC,0
"From June 1 to November 18, 2020, the 11th outbreak of Ebola virus disease occurred in the Democratic Republic of Congo. An expanded-access program was developed to offer patients a single monoclonal antibody plus a triple-antibody cocktail. Mortality was lower among those who received the antibody treatment than among those who did not.",0

"A 56-year-old woman was admitted in the spring of 2020 because of fever, myalgias, diarrhea, and a dry cough. Six weeks earlier, she had had contact with a person with SARS-CoV-2 infection. She had mild ground-glass opacities on chest CT, as well as elevated aminotransferase levels and thrombocytopenia. What is the diagnosis?",0
Clinical Implications of Basic Research,0
Targeting Gene Therapy to Muscle,0
"Gene therapy for disorders affecting muscle, such as Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy and myotubular myopathy, has been challenging, in large part owing to the difficulty of delivering the therapeutic gene to cells within the mass of muscle tissue. A recent study of the adeno-associated virus capsid provides a candidate vector for targeting muscle cells.",0
Perspective,0
"Mr. O.’s achalasia had worsened beyond what his body could compensate for. His saliva kept entering his lungs, his oxygen levels dropping dangerously each time. He needed endoscopy, urgently. The problem was that Mr. O. didn’t share our concern. And he wanted to eat.",0
Managing Glycemia in Children with Type 1 Diabetes,0
M.A. Sperling and L.M. Laffel,0
Management of type 1 diabetes mellitus in children involves close family support and glucose monitoring. Improved means of insulin administration include newer pumps or smart pens that receive data from continuous glucose monitoring and can assist in calculation of insulin doses.,0
